<h1>Foobar's Logbook</h1>

  
<h2>2017-10-30</h2>
Last two days have shown that:
<ul>
  <li>AWS does not provide computational resources in terms of the free account which I need for my test cluster</li>
  <li>those free testing VMs were not connecting in a Docker cluster and just way too slow</li>
  <li>a local physical setup of four machines renders a private local cloud with 25 cores and 50 GB RAM</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Following the OSI model, I had to dig into almost forgotten activities - change hard drives, burn OS installation media and debug networking issues.</p>
  <p>Now, first swarm-wider deployed service converged, and there is even a local (insecure) registry.</p>
  
<h2>Day Zero - 2017-10-27</h2>
<p>Today's unwrapping of some more or less idling machines was a fun, as well as setting up this logbook. Additionally, there 
has been a very pleasant surprise: Amazon AWS grants you with a free entry account for 12 months. So computational resources 
really start to become free... more or less - but come on, for learning it is just awesome anyway!</p>
