<h1>Foobar's Logbook</h1>

<h2>Day Zero - 2017-10-27</h2>
<p>Today's unwrapping of some more or less idling machines was a fun, as well as setting up this logbook. Additionally, there 
has been a very pleasant surprise: Amazon AWS grants you with a free entry account for 12 months. So computational resources 
really start to become free... more or less - but come on, for learning it is just awesome anyway!</p>
